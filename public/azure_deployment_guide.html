                    <p>Initially, I used Azure CLI commands to deploy my applications manually. This method involved typing a series of commands (1â€“9 steps) for every deployment, such as creating resource groups, configuring environments, and pushing the application. Although it worked, it was time-consuming and prone to human error due to repetitive tasks. You can find a detailed walkthrough in the <a href="azure_deployment_cli.html">Azure CLI Guide</a>.</p>

                    <h3><a href="azure_deployment_bash.html">Step 2: Deployment with Bash Script Automation</a></h3>
                    <p>To improve efficiency and reduce errors, I created a bash script to automate the deployment process. By scripting all the CLI commands, I streamlined the deployment into a single, repeatable task. This saved time and ensured consistency across deployments. Check out the <a href="azure_deployment_bash.html">Bash Script Guide</a> for detailed instructions and a sample script.</p>

                    <h3><a href="azure_deployment_action.html">Step 3: Deployment with GitHub Actions</a></h3>
                    <p>Eventually, I discovered that I could further automate the process by integrating CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. With this setup, all I need to do is commit and push changes from Visual Studio. GitHub Actions automatically updates my repository and deploys the changes to Azure. This method ensures a seamless and hands-free deployment process. Learn how to set up your CI/CD pipeline in the <a href="azure_deployment_action.html">GitHub Actions Guide</a>.</p>
