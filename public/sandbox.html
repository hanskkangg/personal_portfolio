    <h1>Welcome to my Game!</h1>
    <p>You have to find the cheese by choosing the right box! There are two empty boxes and one box with cheese. Your job is to find the cheese. Once you choose a box, the host will open an empty box. You will then be asked if you would like to change your box. Press 'Yes' to change your box or 'No' if you would like to stay with your original choice</p>
